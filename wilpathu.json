  "title2": "Threats to Wilpathu",
  "text2": "Wilpattu National Park, despite its natural splendor and ecological significance, faces a range of threats that pose challenges to its delicate ecosystem. One primary concern is habitat loss, driven by human activities such as agriculture, settlement expansion, and infrastructure development. This encroachment disrupts the natural balance and reduces available space for the park's diverse flora and fauna. Poaching and illegal wildlife activities, particularly targeting charismatic species like the Sri Lankan leopard, remain persistent issues, endangering the delicate ecological equilibrium. Human-wildlife conflict is another pressing challenge as the expanding human population increasingly encroaches upon wildlife habitats, leading to conflicts with animals like elephants. Furthermore, climate change poses a threat to Wilpattu, affecting rainfall patterns, temperature, and overall ecosystem dynamics. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation can impact the distribution of plant and animal species, further complicating conservation efforts. Addressing these multifaceted threats requires a comprehensive approach involving habitat protection, community engagement, anti-poaching measures, and sustainable development practices to ensure the long-term health and survival of Wilpattu National Park's invaluable ecosystems."
